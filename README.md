Objective: Demonstrate the continuous integration and delivery by building a Docker Jenkins Pipeline.

Solution build should demonstrate below capabilities:


• Availability of the application and its versions in the GitHub

• Track their versions every time a code is committed to the repository

• Create a Docker Jenkins Pipeline that will create a Docker image from the Docker file and host it on Docker Hub

• It should also pull the Docker image and run it as a Docker container

• Build the Docker Jenkins Pipeline to demonstrate the continuous integration and continuous delivery workflow




Project goal is to deliver the software product frequently to the production with high-end quality.

Tools required: Docker, Docker Hub, GitHub, Git, Linux (Ubuntu), Jenkins

Project Expected Result: Jenkins pipeline with stages, demonstrating the Springboot application build and deployment process automated with Docker and Jenkins with 'Pipeline as a Code' approach
